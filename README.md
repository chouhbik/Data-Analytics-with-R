# Data-Analytics-with-R : Introduction

The goal of the present repository is to give a starting point for people newly interested in R. I chose to emphasize on the understanding of how R works, with the aim of a beginner, rather than expert, use. Given that the possibilities
offered by R are vast, it is useful to a beginner to get some notions and concepts in order to progress easily. I tried to simplify the explanations as much as I could to make them understandable by all, while giving useful details, sometimes with tables.
R is a system for statistical analyses and graphics created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. R is both a software and a language considered as a dialect of the S language created by the AT&T Bell Laboratories. 

R is available in several forms: the sources (written mainly in C and some routines in Fortran), essentially for Unix and Linux machines, or some pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Linux, and Macintosh. The files needed to install R, either from the sources or from the pre-compiled binaries, are distributed from the internet site of the Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)5 where the instructions for the installation are also available. Regarding the distributions of Linux (Debian, . . .), the binaries are generally available for the most recent versions; look at the CRAN site if necessary.

R has many functions for statistical analyses and graphics; the latter are visualized immediately in their own window and can be saved in various formats (jpg, png, bmp, ps, pdf, emf, pictex, xfig; the available formats may depend on the operating system). The results from a statistical analysis are displayed on the screen, some intermediate results (P-values, regression coefficients, residuals, . . .) can be saved, written in a file, or used in subsequent analyses.

The R language allows the user, for instance, to program loops to successively analyse several data sets. It is also possible to combine in a single program different statistical functions to perform more complex analyses.
